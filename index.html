      <p>You may know me from my audition for season nine of Britain’s Got Talent, where I performed a cover of Robyn's <em>Dancing on My Own</em>. Following a standing ovation from the judging panel, Simon Cowell pressed the Golden Buzzer giving me an automatic place in the live shows. Explaining his decision, Cowell said: <em>I've never ever in all the years I've done this show heard a guy with the talent you've got. Seriously. And the version was sensational, and that shows to me that you're more than a singer, you're an artist and that's why you got that (the buzzer).</em> <a href="https://talentrecap.com/the-incredible-journey-of-britains-got-talent-breakout-singer-calum-scott/" target="_blank">Read more here...</a></p>

      <p><em>You Are The Reason</em> started out as a song about something completely different than what it is now. It was originally written from a fragile place of anxiety and not knowing the cause of it, so the song started to become <em>Without A Reason</em>. But as I carried on writing, I realised how every relationship has difficult times but you stick with it because the love you fundamentally feel for the other person overrides everything else. I wrote this song to say thank you to those special people who make our lives better, simply because they’re in it. <a href="https://www.capitolrecords.com/calum-scott-releases-new-single-reason/" target="_blank">Read more here...</a></p>
